  ### Project Overview
  <dd>
    The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict housing prices in California based on various features such as    location, number of rooms, and population density. The project involves performing exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, modeling, and evaluation.

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.
